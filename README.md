## General Description

Unity based rpg/adventure game set in a fantasy open-world setting. Isometric 3D view, similar to Fallout 1/2 or Baldur Gate. 

## Gameplay

Player controls a single character in an open and responsive environment. It will be possible to interact with the environment in a number of ways (cutting down trees, hunting animals, excavating forgotten treasures or entrances to ancient tombs, ...). There will be a night/day cycle as well as four season year cycle with changing weather.

Whenever the player is presented with a challenge (quest/storyline/combat), it has to be possible to overcome the challenge in multiple different ways (stealth, combat, magic, talking their way out of the problem, ...). Not all of the solutions need to be available all the time, but there have to be multiple ways around every game-related problem.

Player is not hard-pressed to go for the main quest, there is plenty of possibilities for exploration, hidden dungeons, side quests, etc. available at all times. The gameplay should be similar to Elder Scrolls or Fallout 2 in this regard.

### Character Management
Traditional old-school character races will be provided for the player characters (humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, ...).

There will be no such thing as character class, the capabilities of the character will be fully defined by attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, ...) and skills (Archery, Riding, Running, Swimming, Swordfighting, Stealth, ...). There will also be perks and special abilities which will be chosen upon character creation or obtained during the gameplay.

### Movement
Movement in the world is unrestricted, without any apparent grid. The sense of exploration should be similar to Elder Scrolls games.

### Combat
Is realtime

### Dialogue
Plays vital role in the gameplay, it's the main way to start/progress/end quests, provides clues to find hidden dungeons, etc. Hidden dialogue options are revealed based on quest progress, character reputation, skills, or special abilities of the character (similar to disciplines in VtM Bloodlines).

### Inventory

### Trading

### Crafting

### Magic

## World Building and Terrain Generation

### World Building
Is closely tied to the story, the world should be "rich" (similar to the later Elder Scrolls games) - there are animals and creatures roaming the nature, camps, dungeons to explore. Not all of the areas are safe to explore by inexperienced characters and not everything explorable is immediately visible. Sometimes additional info is needed to discover the location of ancient ruins, etc.

### Terrain Generation
Terrain is generated proceduraly from bitmap data, it's 2.5D.
