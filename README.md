## General Description

Unity based rpg/adventure game set in a fantasy open-world setting. Isometric 3D view, similar to Fallout 1/2 or Baldur Gate. 

## Gameplay

Player controls a single character in an open and responsive environment. It will be possible to interact with the environment in a number of ways (cutting down trees, hunting animals, excavating forgotten treasures or entrances to ancient tombs, ...).
